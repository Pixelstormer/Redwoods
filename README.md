# Redwoods

Redwoods, despite the name, adds both redwood and fir trees to the game. This is intended to be used alongside the mod
Traverse, as a way to replace their Coniferous Forest biomes with ones that are closer to classic ExtrabiomesXL. Traverse
does an amazing job on all its biomes, but in my opinion it just feels like that truly massive trees are missing. Thus,
I made this mod to act as a companion mod for Traverse. While Traverse is not required, it is highly recommended!

First off, Redwoods actually adds two types of trees:
 * Redwood: A deep red and brown colored wood with lush green leaves.
 * Fir: A somewhat greenish wood with lush green leaves.

Then, there are two variants of redwood and fir trees, both with very large sizes:

 * 1x1: "Normal" - A large tree 24-32 blocks tall, with a maximum size of 13x13 at the base.
 * 2x2: "Mega" - A positively gargantuan tree that can be 32-48 blocks tall, with a maximum size of 16x16 at the base.
   This is the absolute largest size a tree can be horizontally without causing cascading world generation.

The "Mega" variant of trees also use special "quarter" logs that are designed to slot together to form a massive,
contiguous log with rings on the interior. Both variants of trees generate leaves in a stacked cone pattern, reminiscent
of stereotypical christmas trees.
